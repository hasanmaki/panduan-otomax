## Adding an Image

Images use standard Markdown format: `![alt text](image URL)`.

You can also use directives for backgrounds:

![bg left:40%](picsum.photos)

## Code Blocks

Marp supports syntax-highlighted code blocks, great for technical talks.

```python
def hello_marp():
    print("Hello, Marp user!")
    return True
